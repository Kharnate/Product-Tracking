# Procedural Project 

Software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. Program includes the catalog, allows user to enter new products, employee accounts can be made, production statistics can be displayed (total items produced, number of each item type, the number of unique products created) and total display on number of production for different types. <br/>
This is independent class project for class COP 2001 Programming Methodology with the help of Prof. Vanselow at Florida Gulf Coast University. The time period for this project was only 6-weeks. 
During this time I experienced C++, CLion and learned about programming from SWEBOK.
