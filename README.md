# Procedural Project 

Software for a media player production facility that will keep track of what products are produced. Program includes the catalog, ability add new products, employee's account details (login), and total display on number of production. 
This is independent class project for class COP 2001 Programming Methodology with the help of Prof. Vanselow at Florida Gulf Coast University. The time period for this project was only 6-weeks. 
During this time I learned experienced C++, CLion and learned about programming from SWEBOK.
